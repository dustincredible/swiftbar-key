# SwiftBar/xbar plugin with support for The Key v2

This is my SwiftBar/xbar plugin that uses [The Key v2](https://drop.com/buy/stack-overflow-the-key-v2-macropad/) as Zoom mute status indicator light. 

## Setup
1. Install python3. I'd recommend using homebrew
```
brew install python
```
2. Install the python hid module
```
pip3 install hid
```
3. Install hidapi. Again I recommend homebrew
```
brew install hidapi
```
